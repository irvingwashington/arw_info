# TODO

- Detect if dealing with a ARW or a regular TIFF, include that in the output,
- Implement ifd entry type parsing and formatting as string:
  - byte (x)
  - ascii (x)
  - short (x)
  - long (x)
  - rational (x)
  - signed byte ( )
  - undefined (x)
  - signed short (x)
  - signed long (x)
  - signed rational (x)
  - float ( )
  - double ( )
- Merge ifd parsing and subifd parsing into unified logic
